### Moving Average 
The average demand during the last n periods. 
$$
f_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{d_{t-i}}
$$

Where:

* $n$ is the number of periods we take the average of 
* $d_t$ the demand we observe during period $t$ 
* $f_t$ is the forecast we made for period $t$ 

The first forecast will be done for $t=n+1$ 

In scientific literature, you will find often see the output you want to predict noted $y$

A prediction would be noted as $\hat{y}$

When we want to point to a specific occurrence of the forcast at time $t$, we will not it $f_t$ or $d_t$ 

Demand observation: we will call the demand of each period. 


**Noise**: an unexplained variation in the data. It is often due to the randomness of the different processes at hand.
